#' WHEP polities
#'
#' @description
#' Lists all polities defined in the WHEP project that are obtained merging
#' together information from several sources.
#' The term polity comes from _political entity_ and is a more general term
#' than country.
#'
#' A polity can be defined as a fixed territory over a continuous
#' period of time. Whenever a region changes its overall territory, it should
#' start being treated as a new polity. Likewise, if there's only a change in
#' official name for a country or region, but no territory change, it will
#' still be the same polity.
#'
#' In most cases a polity is included in this list as a consequence of it
#' having reported production or trade data individually, as opposed to this
#' data being included in a larger territory. In this sense, most colonies are
#' considered their own polities if there is data for them.
#'
#' @returns
#' An sf object on top of a tibble where each row represents one polity.
#' It has the following columns:
#' - `polity_name`: Natural language name that uniquely represents a polity.
#'   It must not necessarily match the official name of the polity at some
#'   point in time. As a consequence, some names have been shortened or adapted
#'   for easier understanding. Polity names might change in the future as
#'   long as they are still unique. If you need to perform checks for specific
#'   polities, use `polity_code` instead.
#' - `polity_code`: Internal code that uniquely represents each polity. It
#'    follows a specific format for easier understanding. The format is
#'    `"XXX-yyyy-YYYY"`, where:
#'    - `XXX` is a corresponding ISO3 code if one exists, or an artificial one
#'      otherwise, but trying to be meaningful if possible.
#'    - `yyyy` is the `start_year` of the polity.
#'    - `YYYY` is the `end_year` of the polity.
#'
#'    For polities that traditionally refer to the same country (just a
#'    territory change), the `XXX` part will typically be the same as a hint,
#'    so that only the year range will vary.
#' - `start_year`: The year in which the polity starts.
#' - `end_year`: The year in which the polity ends.
#' - `m49_code`: The M49 code for the polity if one exists, as defined by the
#'   [United Nations](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/).
#' - `iso3_code`: One valid
#'   [ISO 3166-1 alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3)
#'   code, if such code exists. Note: One polity could have more than one such
#'   code. If this situation is found, this column might be moved to a different
#'   table.
#' - `iso2_code`: One valid
#'   [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
#'   code, if such code exists. Note: One polity could have more than one such
#'   code. If this situation is found, this column might be moved to a different
#'   table.
#' - `display_code`: A short code that uniquely represents a polity and might be
#'   useful for visualization purposes. It's initially intended to have the
#'   value as `polity_code`, but could change if necessary, as opposed to the
#'   `polity_code` not changing.
#' - `geometry`: An sf `MULTIPOLYGON` with the territorial information for the
#'   polity. Ideally each polity should have a non empty geometry, but this
#'   might not hold while the table is a work in progress.
#'
#' @details
#' This dataset itself was built from various other datasets. The methodology
#' followed to get the final result is roughly like this:
#'
#' 1. Clean data coming from other sources and prepare a tibble with
#'   same columns for all of them, so that they're all homogeneous. Check
#'   `get_polity_sources()` to know more about each source.
#' 2. Put together in a single tibble all rows from the different sources that
#'   were prepared in the previous step.
#' 3. Assign a polity name for each entry in the combined tibble. This name is
#'   also referred to as a _common name_, in the sense that a polity could come
#'   from more than one source, each having different names, and we want a
#'   common one to be able to group these into a single entry. This step is
#'   performed using a join with a manually crafted set of mappings from a
#'   combination of both original name and source, to a common name.
#' 4. Aggregate specific source data into a single entry, grouping by the common
#'   name defined in previous step. For now, this common name will also be the
#'   final value of `polity_name`. The aggregations are these:
#'     - `start_year` and `end_year`: A simple minimum and maximum is calculated
#'     for `start_year` and `end_year` respectively, with two edge cases:
#'       - If an entry in the `whep` source is present for this polity, use its
#'         year range directly. This is a simple way of overwriting the year
#'         range in cases where the original years needed to be changed for some
#'         reason, and the min/max approach does not give the desired year.
#'       - If all values are `NA` for either `start_year` or `end_year`, a
#'         default value is used instead, which denotes the limits of the period
#'         we want to cover. These years are 1800 (earliest source used) and
#'         2025 (present day) respectively. This also applies for the edge case
#'         of using the `whep` source. If there is an `NA` value there, the
#'         default value is used.
#'     - `m49_code`, `iso2_code`, `iso3_code` and `geometry`: Check whether
#'       there is a single unique value, excluding `NA`s, and use that value as
#'       aggregate. Otherwise, fail. This can change in the future if there is
#'       something meaningful to merge but for now it's a useful way to make
#'       sure there is no information loss.
#' 5. Assign a unique code (`polity_code`) for each polity. This is also done
#'   with a manually crafted mapping, which is used to perform a join. The
#'   mapping table defines the polity code for each polity name, the common
#'   name created before, which also uniquely defines a polity. However, after
#'   this code is set, all subsequent operations on polities should be done
#'   using this code instead of the polity name, since it is expected for the
#'   code not to change in the future, but the polity name could, so it's less
#'   reliable.
#' 6. Create the `display_code`. As mentioned before, this is currently just
#'   the same as `polity_code`, but could change in the future if it seems a
#'   good idea to use other intuitive short names.

#' WHEP polity sources
#'
#' @description
#' Lists all sources for each requested polity along with their specific data.
#'
#' @param polity_codes The values of `polity_code` for the requested polities.
#'   This argument accepts three different kinds of values:
#'   - A single string, the `polity_code` of the single requested polity.
#'   - A character vector, containing all the values of `polity_code` for the
#'     requested polities.
#'   - Default `NULL` value, which is equivalent to passing a character vector
#'     containing the codes of all polities present in `get_polities()`.
#'
#' @returns
#' A single tibble with the following columns:
#' - `original_name`: The natural language name for the region in that specific
#'   source, before defining a common name.
#' - `source`: The source this region was taken from. It can be one of the
#'   following:
#'   - `federico_tena`: [Federico-Tena list of polities
#'     ](https://edatos.consorciomadrono.es/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.21950/3SK54X),
#'     covering the period 1800-1938. This is the earliest source used, being
#'     the only one that covers the whole nineteenth century. It includes no
#'     geometry.
#'   - `faostat`: [FAOSTAT country/region list
#'     ](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions) that is used in their
#'     agricultural production and trade data, and covers from 1961 to
#'     present day. It includes no geometry.
#'   - `m49`: [United Nations list of countries
#'     ](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/) using the M49
#'     standard. It was first issued in 1970 and aims to cover present day
#'     countries, but here some historical codes no longer in use are also
#'     included. It includes no geometry.
#'   - `cshapes`: [CShapes 2.0](https://icr.ethz.ch/data/cshapes/) mapping
#'     of territorial changes in independent and dependent states. It covers
#'     the period 1886-2017. For now this is the only source that includes
#'     the geometry of the polity's territory.
#'   - `whep`: Custom made source for overwriting specific data. For now,
#'     it is only used to overwrite the year range for a polity when the
#'     one calculated automatically is not satisfying. Thus, it includes
#'     no geometry or other data, but this could change in the future if
#'     it becomes a necessity.
#' - `common_name`: The given name that will be shared by entries across
#'   sources if they represent the same polity. This will be `polity_name`
#'   in the main tibble obtained from `get_polities()`.
#' - `polity_code`: The unique code identifying the polity. Note that this
#'   is included as a helper but there might be more than one row with the
#'   same `polity_code` in this table if the polity appears in more than
#'   one source.
#' - `notes`: A natural language description of the polity, focused on
#'   clarifying the existence of this entry, possibly including its relation
#'   with other entries. In the case of `whep` source entries, it explains
#'   why that entry was created to overwrite the other sources' information.
#' - Other information specifically found in that source that might be
#'   aggregated in the final polity table. This includes `start_year`,
#'   `end_year`, `m49_code`, `iso2_code`, `iso3_code` and `geometry`. For
#'   more details about these, check `get_polities()`.
