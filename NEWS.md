# whep (development version)

* Add gridded soil **water, carbon and nitrogen balances** (0.5° cell × polity
  fragment). `build_water_balance()` closes the annual cell water budget from
  LPJmL hydrology and exposes drainage (for N leaching) plus footprint terms;
  `get_soc_climate_drivers()` emits the monthly SOC climate drivers from CRU.
  `build_carbon_balance()` runs historical SOC dynamics (equilibrium init,
  LUH2-driven land-use march, LUC C-transfer) and derives ΔSON via asymmetric
  C:N; `calculate_soc_dynamics(model = c("hsoc","rothc","icbm","amg",
  "century"))` wraps the five SOC models (default `"hsoc"`), fed by
  `build_soil_carbon_inputs()`. `build_nitrogen_balance()` assembles inputs
  (`build_n_inputs()`, incl. `build_n_deposition()`/`build_urban_n()`) minus the
  selectable losses (`calculate_nh3()`/`calculate_soil_n2o()`/
  `calculate_n_leaching()`, with the process-based MANNER NH3 model) into
  surplus, NUE and GWP/CO2e indicators. New readers: `read_lpjml_hydrology()`,
  `read_cru_climate()`, `read_luh2_landuse()`, `read_hyde_population()`,
  `read_lpjml_wind()`, `read_soil_ph()`, `read_soil_hydraulic()` (per-cell
  field capacity, wilting point and porosity from HWSD texture, feeding the
  ICBM SOC moisture modifier). New coefficient datasets for SOC turnover,
  humification, C:N, N2O EFs, MANNER and denitrification, the crop
  growth-stage soil-cover curve (`soc_soil_cover_curve`), and the USDA
  texture-class soil hydraulic properties (`soil_hydraulic_by_texture`) with
  the HWSD texture-code crosswalk (`hwsd_texture_usda`).

* Add `ensure_columns()` to complete tibbles from typed zero-row prototypes,
  with safe casts, scalar defaults, deterministic ordering, and explicit
  extra-column handling.
* Add `decompose_weighted_ratio()` for exact Kitagawa/Shapley, additive LMDI,
  and sequential-polar decomposition of changing aggregate ratios.
* `build_io_model()` and `build_footprint()` gain a `method = c("mass",
  "value")` argument for co-product allocation. `"value"` splits a multi-output
  process's inputs (and the pressures embodied in them) across its products by
  economic value (mass times export price from `build_cbs_prices()`) instead of
  mass, falling back to mass for any process whose co-products lack prices. The
  default `"mass"` preserves previous results (#100).

* Add `build_livestock_ghg_extension()`: aggregate the IPCC enteric and manure
  emissions pipeline into a greenhouse-gas footprint extension (kg CO2e per
  `area_code` x `item_cbs_code`), with selectable IPCC tier and GWP100 standard,
  ready to feed `compute_footprint()`. `inst/scripts/footprints.R` gains a
  `WHEP_FOOTPRINT_PRESSURE` switch to trace GHG instead of land (#100).
* `calculate_livestock_emissions(tier = 1)` now also computes manure N2O
  (direct and indirect) from IPCC default per-head excretion rates, so the
  default Tier-1 GHG footprint covers enteric CH4 + manure CH4 + manure N2O
  rather than methane alone (#100).
* Add `build_crop_soil_n2o_extension()`: IPCC 2019 Tier 1 nitrous-oxide from
  nitrogen applied to managed soils -- synthetic fertiliser (F_SN), applied
  manure (F_ON, FAOSTAT "Manure applied to soils"), and above-ground crop
  residues (F_CR, residue dry matter times Table 11.1a N content, net of
  removal) -- as a CO2e footprint extension keyed by `(area_code,
  item_cbs_code)`. F_SN and F_ON are FAOSTAT country totals allocated to crops
  by harvested area. Direct (EF1), indirect volatilisation (FracGASF for
  synthetic, FracGASM for manure; residues excluded) and leaching per Ch. 11;
  EFs verified against the IPCC source. Grazing deposition (F_PRP) and
  below-ground residue N are documented follow-ups (#100).
* Add `build_footprint()` and `align_extension()`: trace a long-format
  extension table through the supply chain end to end, de-duplicating the
  per-year alignment glue previously repeated across the footprint driver
  scripts (#100).
* Fix non-dairy cattle being misclassified as dairy in the livestock emission
  factors: a case-insensitive `"dairy"` match also matched the `"Cattle,
  non-dairy"` item name, so beef cattle received the much larger dairy enteric
  and manure factors. Non-dairy cattle CH4 (Tier 1 and Tier 2) is now classified
  correctly.
* Fix `prepare_livestock_emissions()` failing on real production data when
  `live_anim_code` is supplied as an integer.
* Fix `build_io_model()` not passing the now-required `feed_mode` argument to
  the feed-redistribution step.
