\title{Fill gaps summing the previous value of a variable to the value of another variable.}
\usage{
sum_fill(df, var, change_var, start_with_zero = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble data frame containing one observation per row.}

\item{var}{The variable of df containing gaps to be filled.}

\item{change_var}{The variable whose values will be used to fill the gaps.}

\item{start_with_zero}{Logical. If TRUE, replaces starting NA values with 0.
If FALSE (default), starting NA values remain unfilled.}

\item{...}{The grouping variables (optional).}
}
\value{
A tibble dataframe (ungrouped) where gaps in var have been filled,
and a new "source" variable has been created indicating if the value is
original or, in case it has been estimated, the gapfilling method that has
been used.
}
\description{
Fill gaps in a variable with the sum of its previous value and the value
of another variable. When a gap has multiple observations, the values are
accumulated along the series. When there is a gap at the start of the
series, it can either remain unfilled or be replaced with zero.
