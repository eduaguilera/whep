\usage{
get_processing_coefs()
}
\value{
A tibble with the quantities for each processed product.
It contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year in which the recorded event occurred.
\item \code{area_code}: The code of the country where the data is from. For code
details see e.g. \code{add_area_name()}.
\item \code{item_cbs_code_to_process}: FAOSTAT internal code for each one of the
items that are being processed and will give other subproduct items.
For code details see e.g. \code{add_item_cbs_name()}.
\item \code{value_to_process}: tonnes of this item that are being processed. It
matches the amount found in the \code{processing} column from the data
obtained by \code{get_wide_cbs()}.
\item \code{item_cbs_code_processed}: FAOSTAT internal code for each one of the
subproduct items that are obtained when processing. For code details
see e.g. \code{add_item_cbs_name()}.
\item \code{initial_conversion_factor}: estimate for the number of tonnes of
\code{item_cbs_code_processed} obtained for each tonne of
\code{item_cbs_code_to_process}. It will be used to compute the
\code{final_conversion_factor}, which leaves everything balanced.
TODO: explain how it's computed.
\item \code{initial_value_processed}: first estimate for the number of tonnes of
\code{item_cbs_code_processed} obtained from \code{item_cbs_code_to_process}. It
is computed as \code{value_to_process * initial_conversion_factor}.
\item \code{conversion_factor_scaling}: computed scaling needed to adapt
\code{initial_conversion_factor} so as to get a final balanced total of
subproduct quantities. TODO: explain how it's computed.
\item \code{final_conversion_factor}: final used estimate for the number of tonnes of
\code{item_cbs_code_processed} obtained for each tonne of
\code{item_cbs_code_to_process}. It is computed as
\code{initial_conversion_factor * conversion_factor_scaling}.
\item \code{final_value_processed}: final estimate for the number of tonnes of
\code{item_cbs_code_processed} obtained from \code{item_cbs_code_to_process}. It
is computed as \code{initial_value_processed * final_conversion_factor}.
}

For the final data obtained, the quantities \code{final_value_processed} are
balanced in the following sense: the total sum of \code{final_value_processed}
for each unique tuple of \verb{(year, area_code, item_cbs_code_processed)}
should be exactly the quantity reported for that year, country and
\code{item_cbs_code_processed} item in the \code{production} column obtained from
\code{get_wide_cbs()}. This is because they are not primary products, so the
amount from 'production' is actually the amount of subproduct obtained.
TODO: Fix few data where this doesn't hold.
