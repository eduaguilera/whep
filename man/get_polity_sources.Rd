\usage{
get_polity_sources(polity_codes = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{polity_codes}{The values of \code{polity_code} for the requested polities.
This argument accepts three different kinds of values:
\itemize{
\item A single string, the \code{polity_code} of the single requested polity.
\item A character vector, containing all the values of \code{polity_code} for the
requested polities.
\item Default \code{NULL} value, which is equivalent to passing a character vector
containing the codes of all polities present in \code{get_polities()}.
}}
}
\value{
A single tibble with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{original_name}: The natural language name for the region in that specific
source, before defining a common name.
\item \code{source}: The source this region was taken from. It can be one of the
following:
\itemize{
\item \code{federico_tena}: \href{https://edatos.consorciomadrono.es/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.21950/3SK54X}{Federico-Tena list of polities },
covering the period 1800-1938. This is the earliest source used, being
the only one that covers the whole nineteenth century. It includes no
geometry.
\item \code{faostat}: \href{https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#definitions}{FAOSTAT country/region list } that is used in their
agricultural production and trade data, and covers from 1961 to
present day. It includes no geometry.
\item \code{m49}: \href{https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/}{United Nations list of countries } using the M49
standard. It was first issued in 1970 and aims to cover present day
countries, but here some historical codes no longer in use are also
included. It includes no geometry.
\item \code{cshapes}: \href{https://icr.ethz.ch/data/cshapes/}{CShapes 2.0} mapping
of territorial changes in independent and dependent states. It covers
the period 1886-2017. For now this is the only source that includes
the geometry of the polity's territory.
\item \code{whep}: Custom made source for overwriting specific data. For now,
it is only used to overwrite the year range for a polity when the
one calculated automatically is not satisfying. Thus, it includes
no geometry or other data, but this could change in the future if
it becomes a necessity.
}
\item \code{common_name}: The given name that will be shared by entries across
sources if they represent the same polity. This will be \code{polity_name}
in the main tibble obtained from \code{get_polities()}.
\item \code{polity_code}: The unique code identifying the polity. Note that this
is included as a helper but there might be more than one row with the
same \code{polity_code} in this table if the polity appears in more than
one source.
\item \code{notes}: A natural language description of the polity, focused on
clarifying the existence of this entry, possibly including its relation
with other entries. In the case of \code{whep} source entries, it explains
why that entry was created to overwrite the other sources' information.
\item Other information specifically found in that source that might be
aggregated in the final polity table. This includes \code{start_year},
\code{end_year}, \code{m49_code}, \code{iso2_code}, \code{iso3_code} and \code{geometry}. For
more details about these, check \code{get_polities()}.
