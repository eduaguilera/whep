\description{
Provides N flows of the Spanish agro-food system on a national level
between 1860 and 2020. This dataset is the national equivalent of the
provincial GRAFS model and represents Spain as a single system without
internal trade between provinces. All production, consumption and soil
inputs are aggregated nationally before calculating trade with the
outside.
