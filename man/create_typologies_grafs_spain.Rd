\value{
A tibble with the classification of Spanish provinces into typologies.
It contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year in which the classification is performed.
\item \code{province_name}: The name of the Spanish province.
\item \code{livestock_density}: Livestock units (LU) per hectare of agricultural area
(UAA). Reflects the intensity of animal farming.
\item \code{productivity_kgN_ha}: Crop N productivity, in kilograms of N harvested
per hectare of cropland.
\item \code{semi_nat_share}: Share of total feed coming from semi-natural
agroecosystems. Expressed between 0 and 1.
\item \code{feed_imported_share}: Share of feed that is imported. Expressed between
0 and 1.
\item \code{typology}: Assigned typology category for each province.
This is based on thresholds in livestock density, crop
productivity, and feed patterns. The typologies include:
- \verb{Specialized cropping system}
- \verb{Extensive cropping system}
- \verb{Extensive mixed crop-livestock system}
- \verb{Intensive mixed crop-livestock system}
- \verb{Specialized livestock-farming system}

\description{
Typologies of provinces in Spain based on nitrogen (N) production
data of crops and livestock, using various input datasets and generating
classification maps and data frames.
