\title{Fill gaps using a proxy variable.}
\usage{
proxy_fill(df, var, proxy_var, time_index, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble data frame containing one observation per row.}

\item{var}{The variable of df containing gaps to be filled.}

\item{proxy_var}{The variable to be used as proxy.}

\item{time_index}{The time index variable (usually year).}

\item{...}{The grouping variables (optional).}
}
\value{
A tibble dataframe (ungrouped) where gaps in var have been filled,
a new proxy_ratio variable has been created,
and a new "source" variable has been created indicating if the value is
original or, in case it has been estimated, the gapfilling method that has
been used.
}
\description{
Fills gaps in a variable based on changes in a proxy variable, using ratios between
the filled variable and the proxy variable, and labels output accordingly.

sample_tibble <- tibble::tibble(
