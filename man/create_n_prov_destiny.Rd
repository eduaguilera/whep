\title{GRAFS Nitrogen (N) flows}
\usage{
create_n_prov_destiny()
}
\value{
A final tibble containing N flow data by origin and destiny.
It includes the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{year}: The year in which the recorded event occurred.
\item \code{province_name}: The Spanish province where the data is from.
\item \code{item}: The item which was produced, defined in \code{names_biomass_cb}.
\item \code{irrig_cat}: Irrigation form (irrigated or rainfed)
\item \code{box}: One of the GRAFS model systems: cropland,
Semi-natural agroecosystems, Livestock, Fish, or Agro-industry.
\item \code{origin}: The origin category of N: Cropland,
Semi-natural agroecosystems, Livestock, Fish, Agro-industry, Deposition,
Fixation, Synthetic, People (waste water), Livestock (manure).
\item \code{destiny}: The destiny category of N: population_food,
population_other_uses, livestock (feed), export, Cropland (for N soil
inputs).
\item \code{MgN}: Nitrogen amount in megagrams (Mg).
}

\description{
Provides N flows of the spanish agro-food system on a provincial level
between 1860 and 2020. This dataset is the the base of the GRAFS model and
contains data in megagrams of N (MgN) for each year, province, item, origin
and destiny. Thereby, the origin column represents where N comes from, which
includes N soil inputs, imports and production. The destiny column shows
where N goes to, which includes export, population food, population other
uses and feed or cropland (in case of N soil inputs).
Processed items, residues, woody crops, grazed weeds are taken into account.
