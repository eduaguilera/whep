\title{Nitrogen (N) inputs and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) for GRAFS Spain}
\usage{
create_n_inputs_grafs_spain()
}
\value{
A tibble containing nitrogen input, production, and NUE data.
It includes the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Year}: The year in which the recorded event occurred.
\item \code{Province_name}: The Spanish province where the data is from.
\item \code{Item}: The item which was produced, defined in \code{codes_coefs}.
\item \code{Box}: One of the two systems of the GRAFS model: cropland or
semi-natural agroecosystems.
\item \code{deposition}: Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{fixation}: Nitrogen fixation in megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{synthetic}: Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer applied to the land in
megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{manure}: Nitrogen in manure applied to the land in megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{urban}: Nitrogen in wastewater from human sources in megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{import}: Imported nitrogen in megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{prod}: Produced nitrogen in megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{inputs}: Total nitrogen inputs in megagrams (Mg).
\item \code{nue}: Nitrogen use efficiency, expressed in percent.
}
}
\description{
N inputs (deposition, fixation, synthetic fertilizers, urban sources, manure)
and N production in Spain from 1860 to the present for the GRAFS model at the
provincial level. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is also calculated for
cropland and semi-natural ecosystems.
